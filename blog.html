            <h1>Discuss the scope of var, let, and const</h1>
            <p>Before the advent of ES6 var declarations ruled.There are issues associated with variables declared with var, though. That is why it was necessary for new ways to declare variables to emerge. First, let's get to understand var more before we discuss those issues.</p>
            <p>let is now preferred for variable declaration. It's no surprise as it comes as an improvement to var declarations.It also solves the problem with var that we just covered. Let's consider why this is so.</p>
            <p>Variables declared with the const maintain constant values. const declarations share some similarities with let declarations.</p>

            <h1>Tell us the use cases of null and undefined</h1>
            <p>In JavaScript, null is a special value that represents the absence of an object. It is often used to indicate that a variable does not have a value or that an object does not exist. Null is not the same as an empty string or a zero value, as those values are still considered to have a value. Instead, null represents the absence of a value or object.</p>
            <p>In JavaScript, undefined is a special value that is assigned to a variable by default when the variable is declared but no value is explicitly assigned to it. It is often used to check if a variable has been assigned a value or not.</p>

            <h1>What do you mean by REST API?</h1>
            <p>
                Since we're talking about REST APIs, our definition of an API will not go beyond the scope of the web.
                API stands for Application Programming Interface. An API establishes a connection between programs so they can transfer data.
                A program that has an API implies that some parts of its data is exposed for the client to use. The client could be the frontend of the same program or an external program.
                In order to get this data, a structured request has to be sent to the API. If the request meets the desired requirements, a response which contains the data gets sent back to where the request was made. This response usually comes in the form of JSON or XML data.
                In some cases, you'll need some sort of authorization to gain access to external API data.Every API has documentation that tells you what data is available and how to structure your request in order to get a valid response.
